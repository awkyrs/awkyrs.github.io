### Who are we?

We’re like Batman and Robin, if they had to hold office hours at Saxby’s. We’re here to answer questions about your awkward situations at Penn—because chances are that we’ve been there, or somewhere pretty similar.  “Wow, I just met my roommate’s Dad as I came home in last night’s clothes at 8 am!” Yes, that’s been us. There are moments that are humiliating, hilarious, or genuinely uncomfortable. We’re here every week with advice, a touch of humor, and a healthy dose of affirmation to remind you that we’ve all had finest moments. Your no-judgment place to show your less-than-Penn-face. [Submit your situation!](/submit/)
